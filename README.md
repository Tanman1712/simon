## HTML
### First steps
First want to get the deployable copied over as well as the index.html so that I can at least load it up on browser. Here's the line of code used to run it: 
./deployFiles.sh -k < pathtopemkey > -h wouldyourather.click -s simon

That will delete the html and other files then copy the new ones specifically to simon.wouldyourather.click

### Next Phase
The play page looks the hardest so let's knock out the other two first. Starting with scores then about. I'll make sure to commit after completing each one. I hope I don't need that License thing.

### Final Phase
Just have the play page left. Most of the changes I want to make are more css and javascript based so it's staying pretty vanilla for now.

## CSS
### First steps
First: need to add the link to the css to all the html files as well as the imports to bootstrap

### Next Phase
Add all the bootstrap to the html for part one. Fill out the main.css for part two

### Final Phase
Make minor adjustments to help solidify topics

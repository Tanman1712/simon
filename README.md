# First steps
First want to get the deployable copied over as well as the index.html so that I can at least load it up on browser. Here's the line of code used to run it: 
./deployFiles.sh -k <pathtopemkey> -h wouldyourather.click -s simon

That will delete the html and other files then copy the new ones specifically to simon.wouldyourather.click

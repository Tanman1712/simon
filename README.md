## HTML
### First steps
First want to get the deployable copied over as well as the index.html so that I can at least load it up on browser. Here's the line of code used to run it: 
./deployFiles.sh -k < pathtopemkey > -h wouldyourather.click -s simon

That will delete the html and other files then copy the new ones specifically to simon.wouldyourather.click

### Next Phase
The play page looks the hardest so let's knock out the other two first. Starting with scores then about. I'll make sure to commit after completing each one. I hope I don't need that License thing.

### Final Phase
Just have the play page left. Most of the changes I want to make are more css and javascript based so it's staying pretty vanilla for now.

## CSS
### First steps
First: need to add the link to the css to all the html files as well as the imports to bootstrap

### Next Phase
Add all the bootstrap to the html for part one. Fill out the main.css for part two

### Final Phase
Make minor adjustments to help solidify topics

## Javascript
### First steps
I think I'll write out the js files first then update the html files where they are called. I'll have play.js be it's own commit.
Actually for first phase, I'm going to do all the login stuff together index.html and login.js

### Next Phase
This will be all of the play stuff

### Final Phase
Clean up, maybe some experimentation and anything else I missed.
